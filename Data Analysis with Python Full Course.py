''' DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON - FULL COURSE '''

# What is Data Analysis?
# "A process of inspectiing, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with
# the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and
# supporting decision-making"

# Throughout this course we use Jupyter notebooks. For ease, I exported them
# as pdfs - this was just my personal preference. I retain information 
# better when I repeat the code instead of copying and pasting. Exporting 
# them as pdfs helps prevent me from the 'easy way out' as it were!
